# VERSIONS

What every technical claim in `_jutsu/` was verified against, and when.

**Why this file exists.** v3.1.0 corrected a batch of stale API references and, in the
same pass, deleted the "April 2026 baseline" labels while keeping the version numbers.
That turned dated claims into evergreen-looking ones: nothing on the page said how old it
was, so nothing invited a re-check. A skill that tells an agent "Firefox 128+ supports
scroll-driven animations" with no date attached is not merely stale, it is confident.

**How to use it.** Before trusting a version-sensitive line in a sub-skill, find its row
here. If the date is old and the subject moves fast (browsers ship every two weeks now,
androidx every month), re-verify before acting rather than after.

**How to update it.** When you correct a file, update its row and the date. When you add
a subject, add a row. `scripts/check-denylist.sh` holds the other half of this contract:
the exact strings that were wrong once and must not come back.

Rows are verified against primary sources - MDN browser-compat-data, caniuse,
`api/current.txt` in androidx-main, Apple's DocC JSON, the npm registry - never against
recollection.

**`VERIFY-NEEDED` in a note means nobody has confirmed that row.** It is the one marker this
file uses, and the public to-do list: no separate tracker, because a second list of the same
thing drifts from the first. Claiming one is worth an issue only if you want to avoid duplicate
work; otherwise just open the PR. Finishing one means checking it against the primary source,
updating the value and the date whether or not it moved, and updating the content it describes
if it did. A row whose date moved and whose value did not is a real contribution: it is the only
way anyone knows the claim is still true.

## Web - CSS platform features

| Subject | Verified against | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scroll-driven animations (animation-timeline, scroll(), view(), animation-range, scroll-timeline, view-timeline) | Chrome/Edge 115+, Safari 26+, Firefox: not shipped (Nightly only, layout.css.scroll-driven-animations.enabled, Nightly-default since 136) | 2026-09-08 | Baseline: Limited. ~84% global. Interop 2026 focus area. animation-range-start/end and timeline-scope unimplemented in Firefox even in Nightly (bug 1676779). Verified via MDN BCD + MDN Experimental features + WebKit Safari 26.0 release post. |
| View Transitions — same-document (document.startViewTransition, view-transition-name, view-transition-class) | Chrome/Edge 111+ (view-transition-class 125+, match-element 137+), Firefox 144+, Safari 18+ (class 18.2+, match-element 18.4+) | 2026-09-08 | Baseline Newly available since 2025-10-14. ~90% global. No `auto` value exists — the auto-naming keyword is `match-element`. |
| View Transitions — cross-document (@view-transition) | Chrome/Edge 126+, Safari 18.2+, Firefox: not shipped (Level 1 only) | 2026-09-08 | Baseline Limited. ~85% global. Interop 2026 focus area (carryover from 2025). |
| @starting-style and transition-behavior: allow-discrete | @starting-style: Chrome/Edge 117+, Firefox 129+, Safari 17.5+. transition-behavior: Chrome/Edge 117+, Firefox 129+, Safari 17.4+ | 2026-09-08 | Baseline Newly available since 2024-08-06, ~90% global. Transitioning `display` / `content-visibility` with allow-discrete is Chrome 117+ / Safari 18+ only — not implemented in Firefox. |
| CSS anchor positioning (anchor-name, position-anchor, position-area, @position-try, position-try-fallbacks, position-visibility) | Chrome/Edge 125+ (position-area 129+, position-try-fallbacks 128+), Firefox 147+ (2026-01-13), Safari 26+ | 2026-09-08 | web-features still rates the feature group Limited (position-anchor: normal only in Chrome 151 / Firefox 151 / Safari 27; position-visibility: anchor-visible Safari 27 only). ~84% global. Interop 2026 focus area. inset-area removed in Chrome 131; position-try-options renamed in Chrome 128. |
| Container queries — size, units, style, scroll-state | Size + units: Chrome/Edge 105+, Firefox 110+, Safari 16+. Style (custom properties): Chrome/Edge 111+, Firefox 151+, Safari 18+. Scroll-state: Chrome/Edge 133+ only (`scrolled` 144+) | 2026-09-08 | Size ~94%. Style queries Baseline Newly available since 2026-05-19, ~90%; standard-property style() not shipped anywhere. Scroll-state Baseline Limited, ~69%. Style queries are an Interop 2026 focus area. |
| sibling-index() / sibling-count() | Chrome/Edge 138+, Safari 26.2+, Firefox 154+ | 2026-09-08 | Baseline Newly available since 2026-08-18, ~80% global. Removes the main reason to reach for JS to stagger a dynamic list. |
| interpolate-size / calc-size() | Chrome/Edge 129+ only; Firefox and Safari not shipped | 2026-09-08 | Baseline Limited, still flagged experimental in BCD. ~70% global. Chromium-only — enhancement layer over grid-template-rows 0fr/1fr. |
| @scope | Chrome/Edge 118+, Firefox 146+, Safari 17.4+ (spec-complete at Safari 26.4) | 2026-09-08 | Baseline Newly available since 2026-03-24, ~90% global. Not currently mentioned anywhere in the skill — no correction needed, listed for completeness. |
| Reference stable browser versions | Chrome 153 (2026-09-08, first two-week-cadence release), Edge 151, Firefox 155 (2026-09-01), Safari 26.6.1 (2026-08-18); Safari 27 in beta | 2026-09-08 | VERIFY-NEEDED (drifts fastest in this file). Both Chrome and Firefox moved to two-week release cycles in September 2026, so these numbers go stale about twice as fast as everything else here. |

## Web - animation and 3D libraries

| Subject | Verified against | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| motion (formerly framer-motion) — React | 13.2.0 | 2026-09-08 | npm `motion` and `framer-motion` both publish 13.2.0; `motion` depends on `framer-motion` and `motion/react` re-exports it. Peers react/react-dom ^18 \|\| ^19. v13.0.0 (2026-08-05) removed the optional @emotion/is-prop-valid dep. staggerChildren/staggerDirection deprecated in 12.22.0 (2025-07-01) in favour of `delayChildren: stagger()`. |
| GSAP | 3.15.0 | 2026-09-08 | Released 2026-04-13. Free for all uses (GreenSock Standard 'no charge' license) since 3.13 (May 2025, Webflow); every former Club plugin ships in the public npm tarball. 3.15 added `easeReverse` and deprecated `yoyoEase`. `slow`/`rough`/`expoScale` remain outside core (gsap/EasePack); CustomEase/CustomBounce/CustomWiggle are separate files. ScrollTrigger.matchMedia still deprecated-not-removed. |
| @gsap/react (useGSAP) | 2.1.2 | 2026-09-08 | Peers: gsap ^3.12.5, react >=17. |
| greensock/gsap-skills (official GSAP agent skills) | main @ 2026-07-29 | 2026-09-08 | MIT, GreenSock-owned, 8 skills (core, timeline, scrolltrigger, plugins, utils, react, performance, frameworks). ~15k stars. |
| three.js | 0.185.1 (r185) | 2026-09-08 | 0.185.1 published 2026-07-01; src/constants.js REVISION = '185'. WebGPURenderer + TSL are shipped and unflagged, self-falling back to WebGL 2, but documented as 'the new alternative of WebGLRenderer', not the default. r182 deprecated PCFSoftShadowMap for WebGLRenderer; r183 deprecated Clock in favour of Timer. |
| @react-three/fiber | 9.7.0 | 2026-09-08 | Peers: react and react-dom `>=19 <19.3`, three >=0.156. React 19 only. Global JSX namespace no longer augmented — use `ThreeElements` / `ThreeElement` from @react-three/fiber. React latest stable is 19.2.8, so the <19.3 ceiling is live. |
| @react-three/drei | 10.7.8 | 2026-09-08 | Peers: react ^19, react-dom ^19, @react-three/fiber ^9.0.0, three >=0.159. Environment presets unchanged (10 presets). AdaptiveDpr, AdaptiveEvents, Bvh, PerformanceMonitor, MeshTransmissionMaterial, PresentationControls all still exported. |
| @react-three/postprocessing | 3.1.1 | 2026-09-08 | Peers: react ^19, @react-three/fiber >=9.7.0, postprocessing ^6.36.0. Bloom/ChromaticAberration/EffectComposer + BlendFunction from 'postprocessing' all still correct as written in the skill. |
| @react-three/offscreen | 0.0.8 | 2026-09-08 | Separate, still 0.0.x/experimental. This — not the Canvas `eventSource` prop — is what moves R3F rendering to a worker. |
| CSS linear() easing function | Baseline widely available since Dec 2023 | 2026-09-08 | MDN: safe to use as the easing-guide.md recipe presents it. |
